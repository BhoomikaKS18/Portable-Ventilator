# Portable-Ventilator
This project focuses on the design and development of a low-cost, portable ventilator for assisting patients with respiratory distress, especially in low-resource and emergency situations. The system is built using an Arduino Uno R4 and continuously monitors SpO₂ and heart rate using a MAX30100 pulse oximeter. Based on the oxygen saturation level, a fuzzy logic–based control adjusts the speed of a diaphragm air pump to deliver smooth and adaptive airflow. If the SpO₂ level falls below 90%, an emergency SMS alert is sent to caregivers through a SIM800L GSM module. The system is battery-powered, compact, and cost-effective, making it suitable for use in rural clinics, ambulances, and home care scenarios
